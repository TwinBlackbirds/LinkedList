# LinkedList Implementation
## Written by TwinBlackbirds

--- 

A polymorphic linked list implementation written in C++ for learning purposes. 
Once it's complete, this will be used to facilitate a visualisation app made in SDL.
This implementation is meant to be good enough for production purposes, even though
it would never be practical do to so. The reason for this is so that I can get a better understanding
of smart pointers, memory management and RAII patterns within C++11.

If you notice anything that could be improved upon, please do let me know. I would love feedback!
### Planned:
* `reverse()` function
